## Progress
- The Jacobian loop graphs sent earlier this week
- generation and compile scripts to reduce human errors (like the missing `fopenmp` flag)
- Low output next week due to interview 
- looked into better representing information for runtime
---

## Questions
- in terms of dissertation I plan on staring a more comprehensive literature review to start off with the background and motivation and such, I am expecting this to take 5-6 pages is that reasonable for a 40 page dissertation? Ideally I submit a first-draft for review by mid March if that is okay?
- for representing the data for OpenMP if we use a task graph and memory graph so 
	- Task(id, depdencies, reads, writes)
	- Memory(id, readers, writers)
	something like seems like it would be better and more useful to OpenMP runtime than the previous mentioned
