## Progress
- Had to move over the Ubuntu to install LLVM 14 and 20
- Reformatted repo to separate LLVM code and LLVM 20 in case of discrepancy later i.e opaque pointers
- Built and linked successfully OpenMP on release 14 for llvm
- Need to learn and play with static analysis techniques

## Action Items
- [ ] Investigate LLVM20 Memory SSA

## Quick Notes (during meeting)

LLVM20 allows memory dependency analysis over function perhaps?

A new IR Memory SSA but does reasoning over that at function level?

Have a look at openMP IR.

Need the CG to make sure the openMP function encapsulates all the computation.
