In pipelined architectures, the key performance barrier has been the existence of [[Pipeline Stalls]]. 

There are three classes of hazards:
- structural hazards - which occur because the machine resources do not support all possible combinations of instruction overlap that might occur
- data hazards - occur when the produced by one instruction is needed by a subsequent instruction
- control hazards - which occur because of the processing of branches
