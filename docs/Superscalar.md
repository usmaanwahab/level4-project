A superscalar processor is one that can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle.
It achieves this by having multiple hardware units, for example:
- multiple integer ALUs
- multiple floating-points units
- dedicated load/store units

Allowing the execution of several instructions in parallel.

However, this has to be used in conjunction with [[Out-of-Order]] execution to reap the most benefit. Out-of-Order execution is not always possible due to memory dependencies.
