What interested you in applying for HubSpot?

On a non-technical level I am drawn to HubSpot due to its focus on transparency. I personally value transparency and by extension honesty. I believe honesty is the foundation of working well in a team environment and also for improving oneself.

I also appreciate the fact that you favour autonomy but also provide a guiding principle to help make better decisions with that autonomy. That principle being customer > company > individual. For me, this helps me understand the underlying nature of HubSpot and intrigues me more as you provide an environment that allows innovation and creativity to take hold, without arbitrary or unnecessary restrictions.

The focus on culture is very reassuring and exciting, as you seem to provide a place that isn't just for working monotonously but working on things that are exciting and have real impact.

It's also really cool, that you have strong emphasis on life long learning, I think this is especially important in Computer Science because of the nature of the subject, that continuously changes and iterates. HubSpot's commitment to this through private talks from leaders in their respective areas is really exciting. I love learning various things that aren't necessarily directly related to my subject area or will practically help me in any particular way. Simply, enriching the knowledge I already have and widening my perspective on topics, or even learning about the topic for the first time is very motivating.

Finally, I am also really interested int the #dad-jokes slack channel. I do enjoy really corny joke.


What are you most passionate about learning in Tech?

I enjoy making programs more efficient, either in terms of cycles used, or in terms of energy consumed. Quite literally I like watching the metrics and numbers becomes smaller whether that be time, memory, or latency. It also helps that I really enjoy learning about how a computer works at the lower levels and how processing actually takes place. In fact, my current area of research is focusing on optimising locality in parallel programs, such that the more of data the programs needs is kept in the cache of the processor, rather than on main memory (RAM). I am also taking a really interesting course called Algorithmics II, which has a strong focus on improving the efficiency of code in certain class of tasks. The groups of tasks it focuses on are geometric algorithms, strings and text algorithms, graphs and matching algorithms, and finally, algorithms for NP-hard problems.

I think efficiency and performance is a goal when writing any software, it doesn't necessarily need to be a primary or secondary goal, it just needs to be considered at some point. Code that is efficient and performant (and readable) allows the wider team to build upon your functionality in different ways worrying less about latency and responsiveness. This has a domino effect that customers can have a product that is fast and responsive, allowing them to work with greater efficiency and confidence. A customer who has to wait for their program to do something, when it can be done quicker is not necessarily a happy customer. A customer who can focus on their work, thanks to our product and not worry about time management to use  our product is typically a happier and more satisfied customer.

I experienced this first hand when I worked in hospitality and we moved to a cloud based system provided by Oracle, and to be blunt it was just slow, and clunky. Yes, it needed to do various different tasks, but it lacked extensibility to optimise my specific workflow. The system was not snappy or very responsive. It was just not a good or enjoyable experience.

This is especially important for complex tasks and projects, when functionality expands and the programs get larger and heavier, they can tend towards being on the slower side. We want to make sure the customer has access to the best possible experience, and this concept I believe is reinforced as HubSpot has a strong disposition to iteratively improving and refactoring code as part of the culture.
