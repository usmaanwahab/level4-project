Modern compilers employ the concept of [[Dependence]].

One of the earliest applications of parallelism to improve the performance of computer architectures was the use of [[Pipelining]].


On a modern [[RISC]] machine, typical instructions take on three forms
- register-to-register ALU operations - arithmetic operations i..e integer and floating addition, subtraction etc.
- memory operations - instructions requiring memory access, load from memory into registers and store into memory are both of this type
- branch instructions - change the location in memory from which the next instructions is to be executing conditionally
